A widely-accepted "good practice" technology stack for implementing web services in Java includes:

1. Spring Framework: Spring is a popular framework used for building enterprise-grade Java applications. It provides several modules for building web applications including Spring MVC and Spring Boot.
2.  JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful web services): This is a Java standard specification for building RESTful web services. There are several frameworks available that implement this specification, including Jersey and Apache CXF.
3.  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is often used as a lightweight data exchange format for RESTful web services. There are several libraries available in Java for parsing and generating JSON, including Jackson and Gson.
4.  Maven or Gradle: These are popular build tools that help automate the building and packaging of Java applications.
5.  JUnit or TestNG: These are popular testing frameworks used for unit and integration testing of Java applications.
6.  Apache Tomcat or Jetty: These are popular lightweight servlet containers used for hosting Java web applications.
7.  Git: This is a popular version control system used for managing source code files and code collaboration.
8.  Docker: Docker is a containerization technology used for packaging and deploying applications in a portable and efficient manner.

Of course, the specific technology stack used will depend on the requirements of the project and the expertise of the development team.

There are several good practices for implementing web services in Java:

1. Use JAX-RS or Spring MVC frameworks for building RESTful web services.
1. Use design patterns such as DTO (data transfer object), DAO (data access object) to manage your data and business logic.
1. Use JSON as a lightweight data exchange format for RESTful web services.
1. Ensure that you use proper exception handling throughout the application, and return meaningful error messages to clients when exceptions occur.
1. Use SSL/TLS encryption to secure the communication channel between clients and servers.
1. Use caching to improve performance and scalability of your web service.
1. Use JMS (Java Messaging Service) or other similar messaging systems for asynchronous communication between different parts of your application.
1. Write unit tests for all your web service endpoints and integration tests to test the entire web service.
