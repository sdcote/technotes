     Architect is both a title and a role. As a title, it is difficult to ascertain
     what an architect does. An architecture role is more clearly defined.

## Architect Role

Not a level of competency, but a role.

Aids in the understanding of the entire domain.

Operates at the enterprise or business unit level and coordinates with individual teams.

Responsible for:
- Achieving consensus amongst development teams,
- Mapping technical strategies to business objectives,
- Communicating unified approaches to all levels,
- Conceptual Integrity across all projects… 

While the architecture role operates at the enterprise level, it is a bridge between business and technology stakeholders, translating the needs of each for the other.

Architectus Reloadus

An architect is the person, team, or organization responsible for a system’s architecture

Grady Booch (Software Architecture and the UML)

Not just a top-level designer - Need to ensure feasibility; has skin in the game

Not the project manager - But “joined at the hip”

Not a technology expert - Purpose of the system, “fit”, 

Not a lone wolf - Communicator

## Responsibilities

Define and validate the system’s architecture

Maintain the conceptual integrity of the system

Assess and attack technical risks to the system

Propose the order and contents of the continuous stream of executable releases 

Facilitate communication among team members and resolve conflict

Mentor team members

Along with the project manager, serve as the public persona of the project

## Not All Questions Have Answers

"The life of a software architect is a long and rapid succession of suboptimal design decisions taken partly in the dark.“ - Philippe Kruchten

Architects make decisions with incomplete information. That’s a key ability of a good architect.

Engineers are more discrete and resist making decisions in the absence of empirical data and that’s a key trait of a good engineer.

An architect who is unable to make decisions in an environment where much is unknown, where there is insufficient time to explore all alternatives, and where there is pressure to deliver is unlikely to succeed. Such an environment is to be expected, and successful architects acknowledge the situation, rather than try to change it. Thus, the architect needs to be "thick-skinned" since they may need to correct their decisions and backtrack at times during a project.

## Simplicity

A system's architecture is not finished until there's nothing left to take away. In other words, a system's architecture represents the necessary strategic design decisions sufficient to form that system. 

A stable architecture is essential to every successful system for two reasons:

First, the creation of a stable architecture helps drive the highest risks out of the project. 

Second, the presence of a stable architecture provides the basis upon which the system may be continuously evolved with minimal scrap and rework.

## Engineering Versus Architecture

Engineering is what you can build.
- Engineers can build anything;  it’s what they do.
- Ask an Engineer for something and you’ll get it.

Architecture is what you should build.
- Architects create designs that enable businesses to reach their goals and objectives.
- Helps the business context to ask engineers for the right things.

## Software Architect Role

There are at least 5 architecture domains:

- Business
- Information
- Data
- Application
- Technology

 

## Solution Architect Role

While very much up to interpretation, the Solution Architect role is traditionally one of a sales support. Potential clients have a problem and the solution architect applies technology to solve that problem. Often, the technology includes product and resources of the solutions provider, but not always. In a staff augmentation capacity, a solutions architect will solve a problem for the client without regard to the vendor.

From a solution provider perspective; sales teams identify potential clients and bring in the Solution Architect to clarify a solution for the client. This normally involves the analysis of RFI and RFP documents, holding fact gathering interviews with the potential clients and generating the technical approach the sales team used to present the response to proposal or information requests.

While a solutions architect will have some idea as to costs and schedule estimates, the final numbers are left to the sales and proposal teams.


## Wikipedia

Solution architecture activities take place during solution **ideation**, solution **design**, and solution **implementation**. 

During **ideation**, solution architecture establishes the complete business context for the solution and defines the vision and requirements for the solution. 

During **design**, solution architecture elaborates potential options, which may include RFIs, RFPs or prototype development. It selects the most optimal option and develops the roadmap for the selected solution. 

During **implementation**, solution architecture communicates the architecture to the stakeholders, and guides the implementation team.



## Architecture Domains
Based on the Zachman Framework
There are loads of sub-domains, particularly in the Technical Architecture domain.

### Business Architecture 
People, Processes, Business Rules

The business policies, strategies, people, processes, business rules, products, services, customers, geographical span, partners and competitors define the enterprise. The business architecture is thus the context within which the business operates.

### Information Architecture
Sources and Destinations of information

All the sources of information, supporting business and decision processes, including paper, graphics, video, speech, and thought that define the sources and destinations of information, its flow through the organization, as well as the rules for persistence, security, and ownership.

### Data Architecture
Forms and Types of data

As a subset of the information that drives the enterprise, the data architecture defines the types of data, their form, and the rules that govern their use. The elements of this layer are the only forms of information that must be stored by information technology.

### Application Architecture
Application ecosystem in the enterprise

The applications that the enterprise chooses to access and manipulate its data also help to define its ability to communicate internally and, through electronic commerce, externally.

### Technology Architecture
The technology of the enterprise

Underpinning the other layers, the technology of the enterprise enables or disables the enterprise in the execution of its business strategy. The implication for the technology architecture is that the choice of servers, client devices, databases, middleware, and network components must be linked ultimately to the policies and goals of the business architecture. Major sub-domains are Infrastructure and Telecommunications)
