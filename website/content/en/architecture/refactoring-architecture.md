Refactoring is expensive, many will resist on expense alone.

Assessing the "architecture vitality" Be proactive. Don't wait until it gets too bad to fix.

Architects need to take technical issues and turn them into business issues. Justify the business case for architectural changes.

Root cause analysis

Document a root cause summary

## Determine Architecture Changes

We need to …to solve …and to provide…

## Technical Justification

Technical reasons why the refactoring is necessary

## Business Justification

Reduce costs, quality improvement, reduced time to market, ROI, etc.

Architecture Risk Assessment - what bad things will happen if we don’t refactor

## Develop a high-level architecture refactoring plan

Break into small iterations - Identify technical and business value expected at each iteration

Use a playbook approach to outline the architecture transformations - each iteration should document the final state of each architecture…don't use staging iterations (the iteration has no business value)

Decide on migration versus adoption refactoring 

Migrating is building new and migrating to the new components

Adaption is evolving the components to the new state

## Develop a timeline and resource estimates

Call out performance metrics at the end of each iteration

## Present your case

How did it get this bad? - The project/product requirements changed, it was valid then, but conditions today have changed.

Start with your immediate manager (after you have a plan)

Present with urgency, not with panic. Don't scare anyone

Don't argue, present.
