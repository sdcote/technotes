It has often been said that the boxes get the funding, the lines don't. Well the lines normally represent the data exchanges between the boxes and they can be the most complicated, error-prone part of the system.

The integration catalog is a simple listing of each data exchange for your system. 

It is unique to the installation instance 

Each line on your system context will have at least one entry in your integration catalog. For bi-directional data exchange, there will be at two. For broad cast exchenges, there will be one entry for every consumenr of your data.

Each integration must be fully understood. This document captures all the important details and requirements for each of the integrations.

It helps define scope of the project.

It records Service Level objectives, expectations, and agreements.

Each integration should be monitored and have an associated monitoring strategy.
