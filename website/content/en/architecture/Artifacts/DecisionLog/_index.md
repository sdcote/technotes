Architecture decisions are recorded as they are made so it is clear to all levels why the system is structured the way it is. This helps prevent tactical design from undermining strategic goals.

A.K.A. Architecure Decision Record (ADR)

A.K.A. Architecture Decision Log (ADL)

Document the strategic decisions made and why.

Include all the alternatives considered.

Show the pros and cons for each alternative.

Describe the final decision.

Describe the motivation for the decision.

Provide architectural guidance for emergent design.

Donâ€™t be afraid to re-visit decisions!

Groundhog Day anti-pattern - We keep visiting the same decisions over and over again. To avoid the Groundhog Day anti-pattern, make sure the decision and all its decision criteria are addressed and the complete justification is documented.

Conditions and constraints

Publish them in a central location (wiki, shared drive, SharePoint, etc)

Communicate the architecture decisions - hold white board sessions, present at steering committee meetings, etc.

Invaluable for technical communication.

Often asked, why do we do it this way?

Invaluable when evaluating the architecture (at least yearly)

Records the decision making process, not "just cuz I said so"

Record the prioritized list of quality attributes used to make decisions

Records all the assumptions at the time of the decision.

When assumptions are proven invalid, the architecture must be re-evaluated
