This prioritized list of qualities guide all technical decisions. Trade-off analysis is performed with these qualities in mind to ensure the resultant system remains in alignment with business goals and objectives.

This MUST be generated early in the project and preferably by the stakeholders and leadership.

Ask for this list early before any decisions are made.

If there is no quality list, require a it be started when the first decision must be made.

Make surte the lisk is widely distributed and known by all participants. Business owners and technical delivery team members alike.

Each quality should be completely explained and agreed upon by all stateholders.

## Quality Scenarios

Qualities that are quantifiable are preferred, but not necessary. When refering to the performance of the system, for example, a statement should be made as to the expected performance in a particular scenario. If 100 users make a request at one time, the expected average response time should not exceed 2 seconds.

Quantifiable scenarios allow for the creation of automated tests to ensure expected qualities are being met.

Automated testing of quality scenarios help ensure the system does not evolve into an non-compliant state.
