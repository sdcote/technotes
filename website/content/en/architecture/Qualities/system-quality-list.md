This is not a complete list. It is a place to start discussions with the stakeholders.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :---- | :----: | :----------- |
| Integrity	| R | Guarding against improper modification or deletion of information. |
| Performance	| R | Responsiveness to stimuli (requests & events). |
| Availability	| R | A measure of the time system is running and functioning as needed. |
| Efficiency| R | The system's ability to maximize performance while minimizing resource usage. |
| Learnability| R | This measures how easily users can learn to operate and interact with a computer system effectively. |
| Satisfaction| R | This refers to how users find a computer system pleasant, efficient, and fulfilling to use. |
| Error Avoidance | R |This refers to a computer system’s ability to prevent users from making mistakes or encountering failures while interacting with it.|
| Error Detection | R |A system's ability to identify and notify users or administrators of errors when they occur.|
| Simplicity	| R | The design is relatively easy to understand, learn, and operate. |
| Scalability	| R | The ability to support greater throughput and more work. |
| Documentation	| R | The ability to document the operation of the system. |
| Cost 	| B | Development Budget |
| Schedule 	| B | Release schedule, e.g., base functionality (MVP) vs. full-featured release. |
| Scalability	| R | The ability to support greater throughput and more work. |
| Maintainability	| R | The ability to evolve the system. |
| Usability	| R | The measure of the ease with which a user interfaces with the system. |
| Projected Life	| B | Prototype vs. Utility vs. Infrastructure systems |
| Confidentiality	| R | Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure. |
| Modifiability	| N | Ability to make changes quickly and cost-effectively. |
| Integrability	| N | The ability of separately developed components to work together. |
| Functionality	| R | The ability of the system to do the work for which it’s intended. |
| Portability	| N | The ability to operate in different computing environments. |
| Reusability	| N | Components can be used again in future applications |
| Security	| R | The combined qualities of Availability, Integrity, and Confidentiality |
| Testability	| N | Ease of making a system reveal its faults through testing. |
| Conceptual Integrity | A | The design does similar things in similar ways. |
| Completeness	| A | Meeting all the systems requirements and runtime constraints. |
| Buildability	| A | This system can be completed with available resources. |
| Reliability	| R | This is a system's ability to perform its functions consistently and correctly over time without failure. |
| Interoperability	| R | The ability of two or more systems to cooperate at runtime |
| Marketability	| B | The use of the system concerning market competition. |
| Appropriateness	| B | Human input, expertise allocation, and team and software structure alignment are available. Business process re-engineering |
| Correctness	| A | Accountability for satisfying all system requirements. |
| Sensitivity	| R | The degree to which a system component can pick up something being measured. |
| Calibrability	| R | The ability of a system to recalibrate itself to some specific working range. |
