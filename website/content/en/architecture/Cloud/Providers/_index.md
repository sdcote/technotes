## Summary

When choosing a single provider, it is always safe to stick to the Big 3: AWS, Azure, and GCP. All are widely supported by IaC tools and their APIs are rock solid and growing. It is difficult to beat the global presence of Google and Azure, and Amazon is not far behind. Google edges out the rest when it comes to global networking capabilities.

IBM and Oracle are solid providers and are increasingly gaining on the Big 3. Both Oracle and IBM are slightly more specialized in the workloads they are designed to support so if you have global database workloads, then Oracle might edge out the others. If you have IBM solutions to be hosted, then IBM may be your best choice.

This leaves Alibaba. If you need a solid presence in Asia, then Alibaba may be a good choice. However, considering its Chinese ownership, it would be wise to carefully consider what is deployed there and what data traverses that network. Alibaba may best be considered a part of a hybrid cloud strategy to reduce risk exposure.
