This section contains notes relating to the design and structure of a cloud computing environment, including the components, relationships, and principles that govern how cloud services are deployed, managed, and accessed. Cloud architecture encompasses various aspects such as:
- **Infrastructure**: This includes the physical hardware (servers, storage, networking equipment) and virtual resources (virtual machines, containers) that make up the cloud environment.
- **Networking**: The networking components and configurations that enable communication between different cloud services, users, and data centers.
- **Security**: The security measures, protocols, and policies implemented to protect data, applications, and resources in the cloud environment.
- **Storage**: The storage solutions and configurations used to store and manage data in the cloud, including object storage, block storage, and file storage.
- **Compute**: The computing resources and services (such as virtual machines, containers, serverless computing) that process and execute workloads in the cloud.
- **Scalability and Elasticity**: The ability of the cloud architecture to scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
- **Resilience and High Availability**: The design principles and redundancy measures that ensure continuous availability and reliability of services in the cloud.
- **Integration**: The mechanisms and tools used to integrate cloud services with existing systems, applications, and workflows.
- **Monitoring and Management**: The tools and practices for monitoring, managing, and optimizing the performance, cost, and security of the cloud environment.

The primary goal of an architect is to enable specific qualities as determined and prioritized by leadership and stakeholders. Qualities such as performance, reliability, scalability, and security all have trade-offs and different cloud services may promote some at the cost of others. Designing a well-architected cloud environment involves considering many factors for optimizing cost and performance while enabling desired qualities.
