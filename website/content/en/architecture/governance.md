This is an ugly word. It implies constraints and limitations, dictating what is allowed to be done.

It doesn't have to be that way.

Governance is keeping track of tactical execution to help ensure the project does not go astray of business goals and objectives.

Emergent design can easily lose sight of the bigger picture and the entire system context and make decisions based on the much smaller context of the project. Without the reminder of the overall strategy and business goals, emergent design can easily take the project astray.

A prime example of this is when a development team is working on a project for a specific client. All decisions are made within the context of that client and if the decision criteria only includes that of the current client, the solution as a whole can become more difficult to sell to the rest of the market. The development team made all the right decisions, but the solution provider now has a "one-off" solution applicable to just one client and more difficult to sell to the next.

It is not just the developers who are susceptible to this tunnel vision. Managers tend to only look at their current objectives and direct their teams to meet management goals. A manager responsible for a particular client may be biased and direct the team to do only what is best for their client at the expense of other clients. Management may also be so focused on the "big client" this quarter that they make it difficult to satisfy their next "big client".

Architecture governance helps avoid silo solutions and keeps the evolution of the solution in line with market expectations and business strategy. Governance reminds everyone of the bigger picture and reduces the pitfalls of target fixation.


> I will contend that Conceptual Integrity is the most important consideration in system design.  
 -- Frederick Brooks Jr. (1975)

> I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual Integrity is central to product quality. Having a system architect is the most important single step toward conceptual integrity. 
-- Frederick Brooks Jr.,  (1995)

Who is responsible for ensuring collaborative design?

> Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed from one mind, or from a very small number of agreeing resonant minds.  -- Frederick Brooks Jr., "The Mythical Man Monthâ€œ (1975)

 I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual Integrity is central to product quality. Having a system architect is the most important single step toward conceptual integrity...after teaching a software engineering laboratory more than 20 times, I came to insist that student teams as small as four people choose a manager, and a separate architect.   -- Frederick Brooks Jr.,  (1995)
