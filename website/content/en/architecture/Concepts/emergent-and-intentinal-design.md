## Emergent versus Intentional Architecture

Current thinking on architecture assumes that your design will evolve over time and that you cannot know everything you need to know upfront to fully architect your system. Your design will generally need to evolve during the implementation stages of the application as you learn more, and as you test the design against real-world requirements. Create your architecture with this evolution in mind so that it will be able to adapt to requirements that are not fully known at the start of the design process.
