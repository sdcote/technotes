## Architecture Myths

### Architecture is \<technology\> 

While there is cloud architecture, the cloud is not an architecture, it is a technology stack.

Spring Boot is not an architecture. It is part of the technical design.
 

### Architecture is the structure of the system

Architecture encompasses both the structure and behavior of a system

 

### Architecture is Big, Up-front Design (BUFD)

This is a reaction to a waterfall process, architecture is performed up-front, but only as much as required

Architecture is often performed while the stakeholders are defining the system requirements
