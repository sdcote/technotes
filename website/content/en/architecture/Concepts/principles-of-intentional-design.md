## The Principles of Architecture Design

Current thinking on architecture assumes that your design will evolve over time and that you cannot know everything you need to know upfront in order to fully architect your system. Your design will generally need to evolve during the implementation stages of the application as you learn more, and as you test the design against real-world requirements. Create your architecture with this evolution in mind so that it will be able to adapt to requirements that are not fully known at the start of the design process.

Consider the following questions as you create an architectural design

- What are the foundational parts of the architecture that represent the greatest risk if you get them wrong?
- What are the parts of the architecture that are most likely to change, or whose design you can delay until later with little impact?
- What are your key assumptions, and how will you test them?
- What conditions may require you to refactor the design?

Do not attempt to over-engineer the architecture, and do not make assumptions that you cannot verify. Instead, keep your options open for future change. There will be aspects of your design that you must fix early in the process, which may represent significant costs if redesign is required. Identify these areas quickly and invest the time necessary to get them right.

## Key Architecture Principles

Consider the following key principles when designing your architecture:

- **Build to change instead of building to last**.  Consider how the application may need to change over time to address new requirements and challenges and build in the flexibility to support this.
- **Model to analyze and reduce risk**. Use design tools, modeling systems such as Unified Modeling Language (UML), and visualizations where appropriate to help you capture requirements and architectural and design decisions, and to analyze their impact.  However, do not formalize the model to the extent that it suppresses the capability to iterate and adapt the design easily.
- **Use models and visualizations as a communication and collaboration tool**. Efficient communication of the design, the decisions you make, and ongoing changes to the design, are critical to good architecture. Use models, views, and other visualizations of the architecture to communicate and share your design efficiently with all the stakeholders, and to enable rapid communication of changes to the design.
- **Identify key engineering decisions**. Use the information in this guide to understand the key engineering decisions and the areas where mistakes are most often made. Invest in getting these key decisions right the first time so that the design is more flexible and less likely to be broken by changes.

Consider using an incremental and iterative approach to refining your architecture. Start with a baseline architecture to get the big picture right, and then evolve candidate architectures as you iteratively test and improve your architecture. Do not try to get it all right the first timeâ€”design just as much as you can to start testing the design against requirements and assumptions. Iteratively add details to the design over multiple passes to ensure you get the big decisions right first, and then focus on the details. A common pitfall is to dive into the details too quickly and get the big decisions wrong by making incorrect assumptions, or by failing to evaluate your architecture effectively. When testing your architecture,  consider the following questions:

- What assumptions have I made in this architecture?
- What explicit or implied requirements is this architecture meeting?
- What are the key risks with this architectural approach?
- What countermeasures are in place to mitigate key risks?
- In what ways is this architecture an improvement over the baseline or the last candidate architecture?
