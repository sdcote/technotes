## Discovery

When initially engaging in a delivery transformation, it is [good practice]({{< relref "blog/good-vs-best-practices#summary" >}}) to hold a series of meetings, each with a limited audience and scope, to discuss the current issues with the value delivery streams. This sets the foundation for the transformation effort and informs the stakeholders and delivery teams what to expect during the transformation.

When conducted as a single, day-long meeting, the workshop schedules each meeting as a separate session with a target audience. The first sessions are targeted to the business stakeholders to set the scope of the effort and define strategic goals and objectives for the transformation. Subsequent sessions involve the affected development team leads and possibly team members. The goal is to be the least invasive to the delivery teams, so the entire delivery team is typically not included in the discovery sessions.

### Business Goals and Priorities Report
The Goals and Priorities report summarizes key objectives and desired outcomes and identifies pain points that development and service teams need to address. It represents the business stakeholder view of delivery expectations and is compiled from information gathered during business stakeholder meetings.

### Delivery Environment Assessment
The Delivery Environment Assessment details the current development and service workflows, tools, challenges, and opportunities for improvement to enhance efficiency and service quality.
