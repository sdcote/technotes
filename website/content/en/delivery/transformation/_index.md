One of the things that keeps me busy is helping organizations transform their delivery streams. While organizations may have adopted agile development methods, they have not transformed their delivery model from traditional waterfall methodologies. Now that development teams are generating value faster than ever before, the rest of the delivery stream is struggling to keep up. Traditional organizations are still using old delivery practices. While their development teams may be agile, their release management and operations processes are not.

## Transformation Process

After performing scores of delivery transformation projects and "green fielding" scores of others, these are the ordered steps found to result in successful delivery transformations:

1. **Establish Goals** — The first step is establishing SMART goals for the transformation.
1. **Refine Backlog Strategy** — Ensure the delivery team uses backlogs correctly for the current delivery environment.
1. **Establish Monitoring** — Establish a strategy for measuring the success of the delivery processes.
1. **Source Code Management** — Develop simple management strategies for the elements composing the delivered artifacts.
1. **Build Automation** — Automate the creation of the delivered artifacts.
1. **Security** — Identify and address risks in the delivery stream and the product.
1. **Testing Strategy** — Create a process for efficiently detecting undesirable qualities in your deployment units.
1. **Build Orchestration** — Coordinate the creation, storage, retrieval, and deployment of artifacts.
1. **Artifact Management** — Establish secure artifact repositories to enable consistent, reliable deployments.
1. **Deployment Strategy** — Establish secure and uniform deployments to all execution environments.
1. **Refactoring** — Identify issues with the existing delivery stream and address them immediately.
1. **Repeat** — Establish regular intervals to revisit each step of the transformation process to ensure delivery practices stay current with customer expectations and needs.

While it would be easy to assume this is only for software, that would be a mistake. Any product delivered to the customer can follow these steps to improve the delivery of value. This process has worked for many teams delivering data set, machine learning models, analysis and visualization elements, data science, and many other non-software products.
