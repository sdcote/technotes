One of the things that keeps me busy is helping organizations transform their delivery streams. While organizations may have adopted agile development methods, they have not transformed their delivery model from traditional waterfall methodologies. Now that development teams are generating value faster than ever, the rest of the delivery stream struggles to keep up. Traditional organizations are still using old delivery practices. While their development teams may be agile, their release management and operations processes are not.

## Transformation Process

After performing scores of delivery transformation projects and "green fielding" scores of others, these are the ordered steps found to result in successful delivery transformations:

1. **Establish Goals** — The first step is establishing SMART goals for the transformation.
1. **Refine Backlog Strategy** — Ensure the delivery team uses backlogs correctly for the current delivery environment.
1. **Establish Monitoring** — Establish a strategy for measuring the success of the delivery processes.
1. **Source Code Management** — Develop simple management strategies for the elements composing the delivered artifacts.
1. **Build Automation** — Automate the creation of the delivered artifacts.
1. **Security** — Identify and address risks in the delivery stream and the product.
1. **Testing Strategy** — Create a process for efficiently detecting undesirable qualities in your deployment units.
1. **Build Orchestration** — Coordinate the creation, storage, retrieval, and deployment of artifacts.
1. **Artifact Management** — Establish secure artifact repositories to enable consistent, reliable deployments.
1. **Deployment Strategy** — Establish secure and uniform deployments to all execution environments.
1. **Refactoring** — Identify issues with the existing delivery stream and address them immediately.
1. **Repeat** — Establish regular intervals to revisit each step of the transformation process to ensure delivery practices stay current with customer expectations and needs.

While it would be easy to assume this is only for software, that would be a mistake. Any product delivered to the customer can follow these steps to improve value delivery. This process has worked for many teams providing data sets, machine learning models, analysis and visualization elements, data science, and other non-software products.

## Approaches

There are several approaches to delivery transformation. For Greenfield teams, there is little to change. Teams can begin adopting good delivery practices as they evolve. It is mainly a matter of understanding modern delivery practinces and embracing those that best fit the team's delivery model.

However, change is more complicated for established teams. Existing commitments must be honored, and maintaining team output is a priority. The challenge is how to improve delivery without adversely affecting team commitments.

### Managment Driven

When management encourages teams to improve their delivery practices, it is typically due to undesirable characteristics. For many, this is infrequent releases or unacceptably long intervals between strategically essential releases. Another common issue management has with many of its delivery teams is the number of defects, which indicates poor quality practices, technical debt, or both.

The first step in management-driven delivery transformation is establishing one to three delivery goals common to all delivery teams. The goals are SMART in that they are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-related. Samples of SMART management goals for delivery teams are as follows:

- Reduce defect-to-feature ratios 
- Improve Value Delivery Rate
- Reduce Cycle Time
- Improve Deployment Frequency
- Improve Average Features Per Release
- Reduce Mean Time to Recovery
- Reduce Failed Deployment Percentage - reduce the number of failed release deployments in a timeframe.
- Increase Regression Test Suite Scenarios - Encourage delivery teams to increase the number of use case scenarios automated in their automated regression test suite.
- Increate Percentage of Automated tests

### Team Driven

Teams recognize problems with their delivery processes when they find it difficult to consistently deliver requested features on time without added stress.
