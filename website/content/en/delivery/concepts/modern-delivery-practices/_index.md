    value is slow to realize.

There are at least six team types, each with a different model of value delivery:

1. **Product Team** - Creates deployable artifacts.
1. **Packaged Application Team** - Configure packaged applications to meet the needs of its users.
1. **Tools Team** - Configure and package tools and data to meet users' needs.
1. **Operations Teams** - Configure and maintain execution environments.
1. **Services Team** - Perform services on user request.
1. **Hybrid Team** - deliver value through multiple modes.

Modern Delivery Practices are methodology-agnostic. Teams can adopt only the practices that apply to their value delivery model. It makes no difference if you are Kanban, LEAN, Scrum, GitOps, or use other methodologies. 

Modern Delivery Practices can help your team deliver value more frequently and with higher quality regardless of your delivery model or methodology.

## Practice Areas

Seven essential practice areas cover the entire delivery stream, from development through deployment, and include continual operation.

### Continuous Integration

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment

### Automated Testing

### Dynamic Infrastructure

### Security Automation

### Artifact Management

### Monitoring

## ROI of MDP

Stakeholders, particularly management, often ask, "If X is invested, what will the returns be, and over how long will they last?"

Modern Development Practices are not so much an investment as an operational process, and the number of variables in an organization is too great to make an ROI calculation possible.

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A process in which developers and testers validate new code.
2. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: Creating releasable artifacts.
3. **Dynamic Infrastructure**: The virtualization of infrastructure that optimizes computing resources.
4. **Test Automation**: The scripts that carry out both functional and interface testing.
5. **Security Automation**: The scripts that perform security checks.
6. **Monitoring**: Constant measurement of the environment to *proactively* address issues.
7. **Artifact Management:** Managing versioned artifacts for deployment into execution environments.

Modern development practices integrate development, operations, and quality assurance (QA) work together to meet contemporary business objectives.

Modern companies deliver products rapidly, update them continuously, and maintain their quality rigorously. By doing so, they achieve returns on investment that the old “Waterfall model” or basic Agile methods can’t deliver. 

 There are five categories of ROI:

* Faster time-to-market
* Fewer employees and higher productivity
* No Downtime
* Reduced infrastructure costs
* Improved quality and performance of applications

Of course, "half measures" result in marginal returns. Teams employing only a few of the six practices or only partially employing them will show diminishing returns. Development teams implementing a few automated tests do not achieve the full potential return on their investment as a team fully committed to the frequent delivery of high-quality products through all six practices.

The ROI from implementing Modern Development Practices is complicated. Because MDP improves many of operations' cost and revenue aspects, companies struggle to calculate all the benefits. The benefits are clear if you’re a time-strapped CTO or CIO. Success is defined by the more frequent release of stable, secure products.

At any level of IT, teams will reap rewards from the improved speed, quality, and consistency of Modern Development Practices. There is nothing loaded, complex, or contentious about that.
