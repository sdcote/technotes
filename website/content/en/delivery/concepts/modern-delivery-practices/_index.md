## Continuous Delivery Maturity Model

Years of coaching teams has revealed a set of good practices for delivery teams. These practices have proven to improve quality and reduce time to market.

Successful teams have adopted these practices where appropriate. The mature teams have adopted more of them. Modern delivery practices use the continuous delivery maturity model to assess the baseline of a team, then with the participation of the team, begin adopting good practices from the model.

After each iteration, the team assesse their progress against the model and adopt additional practices that may prove helpful with achieving the team's goals.
