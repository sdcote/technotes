To parody quote William Goldman's Princess Bride:


DevOps is simply a team taking control of both development and operations. Anyone telling you different is selling something.

The common thread across all applications and usages of the term is that the delivery team does not throw their product over the wall to perations to deal with, but manage the delivery of value from inception to realization.

That is it; nothing else. Eveything else added on to the concept is simply somebody trying to tack on their own concepts to make a point.

As far as DevSecOps, it is the security guys making sure we include security in the delivery stream. Modern delivery practices already include security considerations at every step in the delivery process, so DevSecOps is redundant. Security is built-in, not bolted-on.
