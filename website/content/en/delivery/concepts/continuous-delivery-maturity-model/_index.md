The concept of the continuous delivery maturity model was conceived by XXX

One of my larger clients had adopted the concepts and created a "rainbow chart" that was distributed to all its development teams. As we coached teams in modern delivery practices, we used that chart to gauge the teams progress.  As more teams were engaged, the "rainbow chart" was expanded to a list of good practices delivery teams used to improve thier delivery of value.

All the delivery coaches participated in evolving the list. After several months of coaching teams, a list of over 100 good practices were identified for all types of teams. Data Science teams, traditional "code and compile" teams and service teams all benefited from examining and adopting theste practices.

Part of each team's coaching engagement, coaches would sit with the team for an iteration (sprint) and set baselines for several delivery metrics, document a teams workflow, and assess the teams "delivery maturity". We then assist the teams with implementing promising delivery practices from the list and reported back to stakeholders as to the teams progress in delivery at the sprint review and customer demonstrations.

The clients "rainbow chart" based on the XX model had been evolved into a valuable coaching tool that drew on the experiences of many coaches and proven through application of many dozens of team engagements.

The model is grouped into six sections. Each section contains a number of identified good practices in deliverying value to customers.
