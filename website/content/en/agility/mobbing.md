The entire team "navigates" as one "driver" types.

Studies and anecdotal evidence shows Mob Programming is only about 15% slower but:
- Code is peer-reviewed as it is written.
- More errors are caught before testing (more eyes on code)
- Team members learn new things from the group.
- Everyone is familiar with all the code (reduced specialization)
- Reduced need for standupsâ€¦everyone is aware of the state of the sprint.

## The Setup
Optimal setup is a large screen for the driver and secondary screen(s) for others to review other parts of the code and Google / Stackoverflow research. Secondary screens are also building and running tests.

IM tool to allow code snippets to be shared between search screens and the navigator.

PO visits while the entire team is on task

## Types of Backlog Items

- Defects that require trouble shooting.
- Spikes
