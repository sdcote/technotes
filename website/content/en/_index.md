TechNotes is a publicly accessible record of various concepts, practices, procedures, and tasks that have been helpful to me or my clients over the years. This site allows me to share with others while providing a handy place for recording the technical details that help me when serving my clients.

This is part of my [knowledge management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), so it will be limited to topics related to the projects on which I work. Hopefully, it will be of some value to you.
